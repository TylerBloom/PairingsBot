# SquireBot Overview

SquireBot is a Discord bot designed to run and manage tournaments entirely within a server.

The current intended usecase is Magic: the Gathering tournaments.

SquireBot centralizes the tournament management experience entirely within Discord. Due to it's base, it can be interfaced on both mobile and desktop platforms. Users are able to interface with the tournament they're playing in from the table they sit at, outside the venue, or digitally around the globe.
